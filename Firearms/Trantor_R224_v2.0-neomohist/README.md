# Trantor Trantor Revolver 224

#### Version
2.0


#### Description
This is the Trantor R224 v.2.00, it is released under a GPL license. A nail (perhaps an 8d/10 gauge or 10d/9 gauge one) can be inserted in the tube above the system for use as a firing pin. Perhaps a small spring could be inserted between the nail head and frame and secured with table, allowing the system to reset after each shot.  For additional assembly information, see enclosed picture files. 5 frame pins (and possibly 1 mainspring pin) is required, as well as glue.  Three cylinders are included: A, B, and C. A is a conventional cylinder holding 4 rounds. B allows for the insertion of plastic 'meta cartridges' of varying shadows. C allows for 8mm barrel inserts. Two types of mainspring have been included, the previous model and a new system utilizing 2 coil springs and a straight bar ('mainspring_a'). Two hammers have been included, one of which possesses a spur for possible ergonomic purposes. 

Formats included are STL, DXF, STEP, and SLDPRT. 

#### Notes
Simulations indicate that .22 Short may function, but more than one use of .22 LR may cause deformation. For more information, see "Simulated Testing of a 3D Printed Revolver Cylinder" by J LaRocco, 2013 (http://www.peerevaluation.org/read/libraryID:29812)


#### Disclaimer 
No warranty of any sort is issued. This system was designed as a research tool, specifically for materials science and forensics research in simulations. If fabricated as a functional firearm, be aware of local laws (such as state and national ones). For international fabrication, ensure the proper protocols have been followed.  For US legal requirements, metal can be epoxied into the space above the trigger (within the frame), and beneath the mainspring.  Likewise, components can be made out of metal instead of polymers. Again, no warranty is issued. All usage is done at individual risk.
