# WarFairy Winged Grip

#### Description
Alright, I'm bloody TIRED of seeing people trying to control their rifles by putting their thumb over some silly thick rail system on their race guns. This grip is meant to fix that. The wings on either side are thumb rests. This allows you to lay your thumb along side the rifle, using your fingers to clench the grip itself. This will allow side to side tracking movements and very fast target acquisition. For fucks sake, STOP PUTTING YOUR DAMNED THUMBS OVER THE BORE.

#### Printing
Print the grip from back to front. Do NOT print side to side or bottom to top, or top to bottom. If you print side to side, the rail channel will snap down the sides of the grip. If you print top to bottom or bottom to top, the rail guides in the channel will peel away from the rail itself. Print the plug however you like.

Glue plug into place once you have the grip situated where you'd like it to be on your rail system. The nubs on the plug will lock the grip into place. You WILL have to cut away the grip should you wish to remove it.
