# WarFairy Hermes AR-15 Receiver

#### Version 
1.3.3

#### Description

The Hermes series release is meant to be the lightest AR-15 lowers possible. Total weight, not including any support material used, is just about 0.643 lbs (Vanilla Hermes 0.296 lbs).

#### Instructions

Support material should not be required for any parts except the trigger guard section.  Print all parts with as fine layer height as possible, 100% infill. All parts are oriented for printing. Parts should be bonded with Acetone or Weld-On #3 or #4. Parts should be smoothed lightly with acetone or MEK. Ensure interior of buffer tube sections are free of protrusions and are reasonably smooth.  Do NOT test fire for 24 hours after bonding parts together to allow bonds to fully set.

NOTE: If you have trouble printing the plug, make a simple cylinder with a diameter of .255 inches and use that to hold the buffer retainer and spring, then sand it flat against the receiver.

##### Known Issues

Slic3r v0.98 fills in the trigger pin and hammer pin holes. v0.99 fixes the issue. Ensure your slicing program is up to date.

Please report any issues to the #fosscad IRC channel on irc.oftc.net or via the chat link on www.fosscad.org. Please include pictures if possible.
