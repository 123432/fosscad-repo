#### Description 
This design is intially inspired from the vanguard by Shadowfall.  Special thanks to JT for improvements and testing. 

So what happens when you take most of the magazine well away from an AR-15? Turns out, not a bloody thing. It feeds and functions flawlessly, with the magazine being perfectly stable even when beat on. With the almost FAL look to the magazine well, its sexy, light, and most importantly, has been tested past 2000 rounds with a standard 5.56 upper. It has been tested with Magpul PMAG's and Aluminium GI mags without failure. Magazines drop free.

#### Printing
Print from left to right or right to left to prevent cracking at the rear takedown pin hole. Support material should be on.
