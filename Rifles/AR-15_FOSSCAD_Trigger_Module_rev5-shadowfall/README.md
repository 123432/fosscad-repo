#### Description

This is the FOSSCAD Triger Module revision 5, (see Renders/module_assembled-printed.jpg). The module provides a 3d drop in FCG for FOSSCAD compatible AR plateforms. it requires that you use a AR-15 parts kits.  You can then assemble said parts into the module and install it into a FOSSCAD compatible lower receiver.  The module requires a 3mm cross pin to hold it in place (see crosspin.stl) which can be printed, however, a metal cross pin is recommended.  This pin should be as long as the outside of the receiver.
