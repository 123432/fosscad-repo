#### Description
The ultra light version of the ultra light lower. Coming in at 99.4 grams (.214 pounds), it is, without a doubt, the lightest lower currently printable.

#### Disclaimer
This file is recommended only for ADVANCED firearm printers. This has the thinnest safety margin of any of my designs, and should be treated as such until its integrity can be verified. Files are NOT sectioned for small printers. This needs to be printed in a single piece due to the thinner walls. I HIGHLY recommend using Meshmixer to add organic supports, with print orientation being bottom to top of the receiver.

Be safe and happy hunting.
