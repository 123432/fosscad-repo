#### Description
Here we have a generation 3 Glock 26 frame by BadJob. it has the slide rails on the frame. This frame was designed to work with 22lr and will likely not stand up to 9mm or larger calibers. 

Again, this is a plastic railed version tested with dummy slide and LPK. The rail holes version will be tested with full slide after I make rails. Print in Nylon/PETG.
