#### Description
FINALLY! This is the AP-9 9mm Pistol by Derwood. The AP-9 is inspired by the Shuty MP-1 and Gluty, also by Derwood. Special thanks to Warfairy for his contributions to the lower receiver for this project. The upper, bolt design and ejector have been improved and the overall design is easier to make.

**Note (Optional):** Derwood also included a STEP/Gluty_Parts folder for those wanting to use the Gluty lower instead of the AP-9 Lower receiver. Enjoy!
