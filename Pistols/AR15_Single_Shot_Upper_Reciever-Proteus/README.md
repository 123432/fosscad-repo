# Single Shot Polymer AR-15 Upper Receiver -Proteus

#### Caliber
.380 ACP

#### Test Status: 
Untested

#### Description
This is a 3D-Printable Single Shot AR-15 Upper Receiver. The goal behind this is to allow those living
in the state of California to have a gun they can print without it being called a "Zip gun". Because this uses the AR-15 lower,
which is legally by itself a gun, this is not a zipgun (meets criteria of being designed by a licensed manufacturer which the AR-15
meets). 

#### Instructions
Print out either the full Upper if you have a printer capable of doing +7.5 ", or both pieces and use MEK to fuse them together completely.
This design as-is will only work with a Charon v3.0 ABS Lower Receiver, however a slight modification to the rear takedown hole will allow a normal lower to be used.
Add a 3.7 oz piece of metal to either the Upper or the Lower to comply with the UFA. This must be epoxyed on. For materials, do not use PLA.
Use ABS in most cases. If you want to use PC, PETT, or Nylon, you must print it in one piece. 

The barrel needs to be acetone treated before firing as would a liberator barrel. Insert barrel and twist 45 degrees to lock in place. 

Insert a nail into the hole at the back of the barrel area for a firing pin. 

This design requires a LPK (Lower Parts Kit). However, leave out the catch and the mag release (The catch will not even allow the upper to be mounted, and the release is useless as a mag is impossible in this design.)
Printing a LPK is not reccomended as the parts would likely not stand up to the stress. When firing, the AR-15 Hammer is cocked back so as to hit the firing pin.

The creator takes no resposibility for any damage caused by this design. Use at your own risk.
